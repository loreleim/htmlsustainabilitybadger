          <h2>What does it mean to be sustainable?</h2>
          <p>
            Sustainable living is about meeting an individualâ€™s current needs
            without compromising the environment for future generations. This
            can be done by limiting the amount of waste a person creates on a
            daily basis. There are many ways to limit waste such as recycling,
            using a canteen or thermos instead of a single use plastic, and
            using modes of transportation that do not produce large amounts of
            pollution. Sustainability can be practiced in a variety of ways and
