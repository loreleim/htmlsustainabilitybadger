            <h3>What you can do to help</h3>
            <ul class="tipList">
              <li><p>Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage. It is extremely important because fresh clean water is a limited resource, as well as a costly one. </p></li>
              <li><p>Most public sinks throughout the city and the world have been upgraded to motion sensor activation. This helps reduce water waste because it makes sure that water is only being used as it is needed! </p></li>
              <li><p>Once you start to understand how much you use, there are plenty of resources that can help determine how much water your household could save if you switched to more efficient products!</p></li>
